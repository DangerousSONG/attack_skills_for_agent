# SKILL: IDOR / Broken Object Level Authorization — Expert Attack Playbook

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: IDOR is the #1 bug bounty finding. This skill covers non-obvious IDOR surfaces, all attack vectors (not just URL params), A-B testing methodology, BOLA vs BFLA distinction, chaining IDOR to higher impact, and what testers repeatedly miss.

---

## 1. IDOR vs BOLA vs BFLA

| Term | Meaning | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| IDOR | Insecure Direct Object Reference | Read/modify other users' data |
| BOLA | Broken Object Level Authorization (OWASP API Top 10 A1) | Same as IDOR, API terminology |
| BFLA | Broken Function Level Authorization | Low-priv user accesses HIGH-PRIV functions (e.g., admin endpoints) |

**Key distinction**: 
- BOLA = accessing **object** you shouldn't own (data belonging to other users)
- BFLA = accessing **function** you shouldn't be authorized for (admin CRUD operations, bulk actions, user management)

---

## 2. WHERE TO FIND OBJECT IDs (ALL LOCATIONS)

Don't stop at URL path parameters — IDs appear in:

```
URL path:        GET /api/v1/users/1234/profile
URL query:       GET /orders?order_id=982
Request body:    {"userId": 1234, "action": "view"}
JSON fields:     {"resource": {"id": 5678, "type": "invoice"}}
Headers:         X-User-ID: 1234
                 X-Account-ID: 9999
Cookies:         user_id=1234; account=org_5678
GraphQL args:    query { user(id: "1234") { ... } }
Form fields:     <input name="documentId" value="5678">
WebSocket msgs:  {"event":"subscribe","channel_id":9999}
```

---

## 3. A-B TESTING METHODOLOGY

The most systematic IDOR test approach:

```
Step 1: Create two test accounts: UserA and UserB
Step 2: Perform all actions as UserA, capture all requests
        (profile edit, order view, password change, file access, etc.)
Step 3: Note every object ID created or accessed by UserA
Step 4: Authenticate as UserB
Step 5: Replay UserA's requests using UserB's session token
Step 6: If UserB can read/modify UserA's data → BOLA confirmed

Victim matters: for real bugs, target existing users, not test accounts.
Report evidence: show UserA owns the resource, UserB accessed it.
```

## 4. ID TYPE ITS IMPLICATIONS

| ID Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential int | `id=1001` → `id=1002` | Easy prediction, high hit rate |
| UUID v4 | `550e8400-...` | Need to find UUID from other endpoints |
| UUID v1 | Clock-based UUID | Time-predictable! Extract timestamp/MAC |
| GUIDs from own data | See in responses | Collect all UUIDs from your own account data first |
| Hashed IDs | `md5(user_id)` | Try hashing sequential ints |
| Encoded IDs | base64(`{"id":1001}`) | Decode → modify → re-encode |
| Compound IDs | `/api/users/1/orders/5` | Both IDs may be independently verifiable |

---

## 5. HORIZONTAL vs VERTICAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

**Horizontal**: UserA accesses UserB's data (same privilege level)
```
GET /api/account/1234/statement     ← you are user 5678
```

**Vertical**: Low-priv user accesses admin-only functions
```
POST /api/admin/users/delete        ← normal user calling admin endpoint
GET /api/admin/all-users
PUT /api/users/1234/role {"role":"admin"}
```

**Combined**: Low-priv IDOR that grants privilege escalation
```
GET /api/v1/users/1/details → read admin user's auth token
```

---

## 6. HTTP METHOD ESCALATION

When `GET /resource/1234` is properly restricted, test ALL other verbs:

```http
GET    /api/v1/users/UserA_ID    ← might be blocked
POST   /api/v1/users/UserA_ID    ← different code path, might not check authz
PUT    /api/v1/users/UserA_ID    ← update another user's data
DELETE /api/v1/users/UserA_ID    ← delete another user's account
PATCH  /api/v1/users/UserA_ID    ← partial update (often missed in authz checks)
```

**Why this works**: Authorization logic is often implemented per-method, and developers forget edge cases.

---

## 7. PARAMETER POLLUTION & TYPE CONFUSION

When `id=1234` is validated, try:
```
id[]=1234&id[]=5678          ← array — app may use first or last
id=5678&id=1234              ← duplicate — app may prefer first or last
{"id": "1234"}               ← string vs int: might hit different code path
{"id": [1234]}               ← array in JSON
{"userId": 1234, "id": 5678} ← two ID fields — which is used for authz?
```

**JSON Type Confusion**:
```json
{"userId": "1234"}   vs   {"userId": 1234}
```
Some ORMs handle string vs integer differently in queries.

## 8. BFLA (FUNCTION LEVEL) ATTACKS

### Common BFLA Endpoints to Test

```http
# User management (admin-only in design):
GET /api/v1/admin/users
DELETE /api/v1/users/{any_user_id}
PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id}/role

# Bulk operations:
POST /api/v1/users/bulk-delete
GET /api/v1/export/all-data
